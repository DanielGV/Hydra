Hydra Processing Framework

Getting started
	1. Install MongoDB, and start it
	2. Check out and build hydra-core
	3. Start the built jar with ÎéÎíjava -jar hydra-core-jar-with-dependencies.jarÎéÎí or just run the Main class from your IDE
	
	You now have a running pipeline system. Try adding some documents using the API classes or the input-stages and play around with it.

For a basic pipeline you will need the following jars:
	hydra-core-jar-with-dependencies
	hydra-admin-jar-with-dependencies
	basic-stages-jar-with-dependencies
								
Starting an AbstractStage-derived stage

	Let's say we want to change the field source in all documents that have been touched by the stage extractPDFMetadata to ÎéÎíPDFÎéÎí. It should modify documents in the database intranet. Since our stage makes static changes to fields, we can use the stage SetStaticFieldStage (included in basic-stages) instead of building our own. Let's call our stage fixWrongSourceType.

	When loading a stage it will look for a properties file located on the class path, called fixWrongSourceType.properties in our case. This properties file should contain a JSON map of parameters for the stage. In the case of our fixWrongSourceType stage, it could look like this:

											
	{
		stageClass: "com.findwise.hydra.stage.SetStaticFieldStage",
		queryOptions: ["touched(extractTitles,true)"],
		fieldNames: ["source"],
		fieldValues: ["web"]
	}
																		
	Now we want to start our stage. To do this, open a terminal in the directory where you keep your Hydra jars and type:
		java -jar hydra-admin-jar-with-dependencies.jar add fixWrongSourceType basic-stages-jar-with-dependencies.jar intranet
